# Join The Crowd
- a Balatro mod that adds 26 Jokers, some of which being mainly unbalanced legendaries based off of my own characters.
- This is also my first Balatro mod, so it might be a little bit garbage.
- Requires Steamodded! all work done for this mod has been done and tested with Steamodded build 1311a, so playing this on builds beyond that may cause bugs to occur!
# UPDATE v1.1.1
- 4 New Jokers (Mad Queen, Double Time, The Brunswick, Jebaited)
- Reskinned some Legendaries (Milky, Benjamin, Ra'th)
- Bug fixes and whatnot
