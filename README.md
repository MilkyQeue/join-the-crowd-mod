# Join The Crowd
- a Balatro mod that adds 32 Jokers, some of which being mainly unbalanced legendaries based off of my own characters.
- This is also my first Balatro mod, so it might be a little bit garbage.
- Requires Steamodded! all work done for this mod has been done and tested with Steamodded build 1311a, so playing this on builds beyond that may cause bugs to occur!
- For info on added Jokers, please refer to the spreadsheet! https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X0YIgEToC36syr9YkQakUV_-wFXahilduESiFBr8rJY/edit?usp=sharing
